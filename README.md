Description of the code:
Problem 1:
Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it. 
Input: python
Output: ntyp
Solution:
1. String is taken from the user and then it is stored in  ‘input_string” variable.
2. The last two characters were deleted using the string-slicing operator and stored in the     "resultant_string" variable.
3. Finally, the string is printed in reverse order.
   
Arithematic operations:
1.	Any two integers are considered from the user and perfomed 4 arithmetic operations on those numbers.
2.	The ouput is now printed as shown below

Problem 2: 
Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’. 
Input: String
Output: String
Solution:
1. Enter a sentence of the user choice
2. Using the sentence.replace(sub_string1, sub_string2) method, the word ‘python’ is replaced with ‘pythons’. This method takes an input string and replaces every instance of sub_string1 with sub_string2.
3. The resultant string is printed on the console.

Problem 3: 
Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input classscore. Use the grading scheme we are using in this class.
Input: Integer
Output: String
Solution:
1. Considering a program taking an integer as input from the user and stores it in the "class_score" variable.
2. Using if and elif conditions, the value is categorised for the criteria for a grade.
3. When the variable matches the condition, the corresponding print function is executed, and the grade is displayed on the console.
